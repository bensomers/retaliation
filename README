Instructions:

API is built using the ruby-usb library, which is a bit of a maintenance nightmare but
appears to be the best available option.

Installation instructions from http://www.jedi.be/blog/2009/11/11/ruby-usb-libusb/

#1: Install libusb-compat via MacPorts. (I tried installing from source, couldn't get
  it to work, strongly recommend MacPorts here).
#2: Download ruby-usb: http://www.a-k-r.org/ruby-usb/
#3: Open up the ruby-usb code, and replace extconf.rb with the following:

    require 'mkmf' 
    find_header("usb.h", "/opt/local/include") 
    find_library("usb", nil, "/opt/local/lib") 
    have_library("usb", "usb_init") 
    create_makefile('usb')

#4: Run the following: ARCHFLAGS="-arch i386" ruby extconf.rb
#5: make
#6: make install (might need rvmsudo)
#7: Should be working.

The API should work fine as long as your missile launcher is plugged in. You *should*
even be able to seamlessly run multiple missile launchers in parallel. I will be 
using this feature and verifying that it works as intended.
